# User Story: Sensitive Data Protection

### Story: As a user, I want my sensitive personal information to be protected with additional verification so that my financial and contact details remain secure even if someone gains access to my account.

---

## Background

Our user profile application currently displays all user information openly once authenticated. With increasing security concerns and regulatory requirements, we need to implement an additional layer of protection for sensitive data.

**Current Profile Sections:**
- Personal Information (Name, Date of Birth)
- Contact Information (Email, Phone) 
- Address Information (Post/Home Address)
- Banking Information (Bank details)
- Social Media Links

**Problem Statement:**
Users are concerned about the security of their financial and contact information. If someone gains access to their account (shared computer, shoulder surfing, etc.), all sensitive data is immediately visible.

**As a user,**  
I want my sensitive personal information (contact details and banking information) to be protected with additional email verification  
**So that** even if someone gains access to my account, they cannot view my financial and contact details without additional authentication.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Sensitive Section Identification
**Given** I am logged into my account  
**When** I navigate to my profile page  
**Then** the Contact Information and Banking Information sections should be marked as "sensitive" and locked by default  
**And** other sections (Personal Info, Address, Social Media) should remain normally accessible

### AC2: Locked State Display
**Given** I am viewing my profile with sensitive sections locked  
**When** I look at the Contact Information and Banking Information sections  
**Then** I should see only the section header with a lock icon  
**And** the section content should be completely hidden (no form fields or data visible)  
**And** there should be an "Unlock Sensitive Data" button in place of the content

### AC3: Verification Request
**Given** I click the "Unlock Sensitive Data" button  
**When** the request is processed  
**Then** a modal should appear with a professional UI  
**And** the modal should display "A verification code has been sent to your email"  
**And** there should be a 6-digit code input field  
**And** Submit, Cancel, and Resend buttons should be available  
**And** a 6-digit code should be generated and logged to the backend console (simulating email)

### AC4: Code Verification
**Given** I have received a verification code  
**When** I enter the correct 6-digit code and submit  
**Then** the code should be validated against the backend  
**And** if valid, all sensitive sections should unlock simultaneously  
**And** the sections should show their full content and return to normal edit/view mode  
**And** a 15-minute countdown timer should start

### AC5: Session Management
**Given** I have successfully unlocked sensitive sections  
**When** the 15-minute timer is active  
**Then** I should be able to view and edit sensitive data normally  
**And** a persistent timer UI should show the remaining time  
**And** I should receive a warning 1 minute before expiration  
**And** when the timer expires, sensitive sections should automatically lock

### AC6: Security Features
**Given** I am using the verification system  
**When** I interact with the security features  
**Then** verification codes should expire after 5 minutes  
**And** I should be limited to 3 verification attempts  
**And** there should be rate limiting on code generation requests  
**And** all security events should be logged for audit purposes

## Technical Implementation Guidelines

### Architecture Considerations
You have freedom to design the technical implementation, but consider these aspects:

**API Design:**
- RESTful endpoints for sensitive access flow
- Proper HTTP status codes and error responses
- Rate limiting and security headers

**Frontend Architecture:**
- State management for locked/unlocked states
- Timer implementation with visual feedback
- Modal/popup for verification flow
- Error handling and loading states

### Security Requirements
- All validation must happen on the server side
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Secure token handling and session management
- Input sanitization and validation
- Comprehensive audit logging


## Implementation Notes

### Development Constraints
- **Email Integration**: Skip actual email sending - log verification codes to console
- **Security**: Rate limiting and attempt restrictions as specified in AC6

### UI/UX Reference

**Locked State Example:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🔒 Contact Information              │
│                                     │
│     [Unlock Sensitive Data]         │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Verification Modal Example:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🔐 Verify Your Identity             │
│                                     │
│ A 6-digit code has been sent to     │
│ your email address.                 │
│                                     │
│ Enter verification code:            │
│ [□][□][□][□][□][□]                  │
│                                     │
│ [Submit] [Cancel] [Resend Code]     │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Unlocked State with Timer:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🔓 Contact Information              │
│                                     │
│ [Normal section content with        │
│  edit/view functionality]           │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```
